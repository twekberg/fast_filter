fast_filter
===========

Fast filtering for when you hare a large amount of data to display.

Overview
--------

Based on Chris Smith's Lightning Fast Filtering in JavaScript (https://chrissmith.xyz/lightning-fast-filtering-in-javascript/). I added pagination.

Detail
------

After cloning this repo, point your browser to fast.html. The
Javascript and CSS are in the same directory. 

The change was to add pagination which the original version didn't
have.
